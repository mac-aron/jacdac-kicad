# jacdac-kicad

A friendly fork of Matt Oppenheim's Jacdac KiCad footprint and symbol libraries, with some updated silkscreens and additional footprints, such as the STM stand-offs footprints.

`./convert.sh` is a shell script that uses easyeda2kicad Python tool to download symbols, footprints, and 3D models from LCSC.
